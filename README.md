# universality

An investigation into the application of universal, EOS-independent relations in Gravitational Wave astronomy.

The basic idea is to use KDE sampling to approximate distributions from a finite set of samples. We provide tools to determine the optimal bandwidth for the KDE algorithm along with tools to both visualize and apply the resulting KDE to sets of samples, computing things like marginal likelihoods or effective priors.
